## Prompt 1
Is revenue cat meant to be used on client?

### Response
Yes, RevenueCat is primarily designed to be used on the client side, especially in mobile and web applications, for managing in-app purchases and subscriptions. It provides SDKs for iOS, Android, and web platforms, allowing developers to integrate in-app purchase functionality directly into their client-side applications. 

The SDKs handle tasks such as:

1. **Purchasing and Subscription Management:** Facilitating the purchase flow and managing subscriptions across multiple platforms.
2. **Receipt Validation:** Automatically validating purchase receipts with the appropriate stores (Apple, Google, etc.).
3. **Entitlement Management:** Managing user access to premium features based on their subscription status.
4. **Analytics and Revenue Tracking:** Providing tools to track and analyze in-app revenue and user behavior.

However, while the primary usage is on the client, you can also interact with RevenueCat's API from a backend server (e.g., using Node.js) to verify subscription statuses, manage customer information, or perform other tasks that require server-side operations【6†source】【7†source】.

Show complete code. Also please browse another approach using web hook to send email receipt

### Response
To handle email receipts after a purchase in a React Native app using RevenueCat, you can approach this in two ways: by manually handling it in your backend or by utilizing RevenueCat's webhooks.

### 1. **Manual Backend Approach:**

Here’s a simplified workflow:

1. **Capture the Purchase:**
   After a successful purchase, RevenueCat will provide details about the purchase. You can capture this information using the RevenueCat SDK in your React Native app.

2. **Send Purchase Data to Your Backend:**
   Send the purchase details to your backend server, where you can validate the receipt using RevenueCat's API or directly through Apple/Google APIs.

3. **Send Email Receipt:**
   Once the backend confirms the purchase, use an email service like SendGrid or Amazon SES to send the receipt to the user’s email.

Here is an example in JavaScript:

```javascript
// In your React Native app
const purchaseProduct = async (package) => {
  try {
    const purchaseMade = await Purchases.purchasePackage(package);
    // Send purchase details to your backend
    const response = await fetch('https://your-backend.com/api/send-receipt', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({
        receipt: purchaseMade.purchaseToken,  // This may vary depending on the store
        userEmail: user.email,
      }),
    });

    const result = await response.json();
    console.log(result);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Purchase error:', error);
  }
};

// On your backend server
app.post('/api/send-receipt', async (req, res) => {
  const { receipt, userEmail } = req.body;

  // Validate the receipt with RevenueCat API or Apple/Google APIs here

  // Once validated, send the email
  await sendEmailReceipt(userEmail, receipt);
  res.status(200).json({ message: 'Receipt sent successfully' });
});

const sendEmailReceipt = async (email, receipt) => {
  // Use an email service like SendGrid
  await sendgrid.send({
    to: email,
    from: 'no-reply@yourapp.com',
    subject: 'Your Purchase Receipt',
    text: `Thank you for your purchase! Here is your receipt: ${receipt}`,
  });
};
```

### 2. **Using RevenueCat Webhooks:**

Alternatively, you can set up webhooks in RevenueCat to automate the process of sending email receipts without needing to interact with the app directly:

1. **Set Up Webhook in RevenueCat Dashboard:**
   In your RevenueCat dashboard, set up a webhook to trigger when an `INITIAL_PURCHASE` event occurs. You can point this webhook to your server's endpoint.

2. **Handle Webhook Event on Your Server:**
   On your backend, set up a route to receive the webhook event from RevenueCat. Validate the event and then trigger an email receipt using your preferred email service.

Here’s an example:

```javascript
// Set up a webhook endpoint on your backend
app.post('/webhooks/revenuecat', async (req, res) => {
  const { event, user } = req.body;

  if (event.type === 'INITIAL_PURCHASE') {
    const receipt = event.data.latest_receipt;

    // Send email receipt
    await sendEmailReceipt(user.email, receipt);
  }

  // Respond to RevenueCat
  res.status(200).send('Webhook received');
});

const sendEmailReceipt = async (email, receipt) => {
  // Use an email service like SendGrid
  await sendgrid.send({
    to: email,
    from: 'no-reply@yourapp.com',
    subject: 'Your Purchase Receipt',
    text: `Thank you for your purchase! Here is your receipt: ${receipt}`,
  });
};
```

Using webhooks allows you to automate receipt emails efficiently without relying on the client app to send data, ensuring better reliability and security. Additionally, this method supports various other purchase lifecycle events like cancellations, renewals, and billing issues【24†source】【25†source】【26†source】.
